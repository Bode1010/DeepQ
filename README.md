# DeepQRepository
This is a repository holding my adventures into reinforcement learning and git for the first time. I did not take any courses on this so
please don't expect too much from me.

All the classes used to create this project were built from scratch by me, so I'm fairly certain they are a good distance away from
professional standard. If for some reason you are ever in so desperate a need for a sub par neural network class, then this is the code
for you :).

I used sfml on windows to create this so if you want to run it on your windows computer you will need to install sfml. In this
repository are the main files in the application, stored here in case something bad ever happens to my computer.
